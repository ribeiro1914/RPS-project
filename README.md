# Webcam Interface

This project provides a Python interface to access the webcam. It includes utility functions and classes to initialize the webcam, capture frames, and perform any desired operations on the webcam feed.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files:

- `src/main.py`: This file is the main script of the project. It provides an interface to access the webcam. You can define functions or classes in this file to interact with the webcam.

- `src/webcam.py`: This file contains utility functions or classes related to webcam access. You can define functions in this file to open the webcam, capture frames, adjust camera settings, and handle any webcam-related operations.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the project dependencies. It specifies the Python packages required for the project to run successfully. You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

To use the webcam interface, you can import the necessary functions or classes from the `main.py` and `webcam.py` files in your own Python script. You can then call these functions or use these classes to access the webcam and perform desired operations.

Here is an example usage:

```python
from src.main import WebcamInterface

# Create an instance of the WebcamInterface class
webcam = WebcamInterface()

# Initialize the webcam
webcam.initialize()

# Capture a frame from the webcam
frame = webcam.capture_frame()

# Perform operations on the frame
# ...

# Release the webcam resources
webcam.release()
```

Please note that the specific implementation details of the webcam interface and its functionalities are not provided in this project. You will need to define the functions or classes in the `main.py` and `webcam.py` files according to your requirements.

For more information, please refer to the source code and comments in the `main.py` and `webcam.py` files.
