    Process the captured frame using a trained model (e.g., for object detection, classification).
    The model is assumed to be a pre-trained machine learning model that can take an image as input and return some form of processed output.

    Parameters:
    - frame: The captured frame from a video or camera.
    - model: A pre-trained model that can process images.

    Returns:
    - processed_frame: The frame after being processed by the model.
